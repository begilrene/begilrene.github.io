It's been a long week of applying! The recession hit quite hard, and my family's
health issues haven't helped either. My father had a stroke, and my elder brothers
had already found work. I needed to put things on hold to take care of them,
but it's been almost two years since I've graduated. I think it's about time to be
getting back into the corporate world!

For this week, I decided to try to implement some alternate comment scheme to disqus.
Let me know if you prefer [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) to it!

Signing off.
